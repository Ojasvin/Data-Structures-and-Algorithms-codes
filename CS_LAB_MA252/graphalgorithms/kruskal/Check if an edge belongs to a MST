To Check if an edge belongs to a MST 

For checking if an edge belongs to a MST we use the cycle property which states "For any cycle C in the graph, 
if the weight of an edge e of C is larger than the weights of all other edges of C, then this edge cannot belong to an MST."

Now, run the following O(E+V) algorithm to test if the edge E connecting vertices u and v will be a part of some MST or not.

Step 1

Run dfs from one of the end-points(either u or v) of the edge E considering only those edges that have weight less than that of E.

Step 2

Case 1- If at the end of this dfs, the vertices u and v get connected, then edge E cannot be a part of some MST. 
        This is because in this case there definitely exists a cycle in the graph with the edge E having the maximum weight and 
        it cannot be a part of the MST(from the cycle property).

Case 2- But if at the end of the dfs u and v stay disconnected, then edge E must be the part of some MST
        as in this case E is not always the maximum weight edge of all the cycles that it is a part of.
